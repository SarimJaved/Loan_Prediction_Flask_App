# Loan Prediction Flask App  

This project is a **Flask-based web application** designed to predict loan eligibility. It features a simple **frontend** built using Flask, where users input loan-related details. The **backend** integrates a trained Random Forest machine learning model, which determines loan approval based on input parameters. Additionally, the project includes scripts for **training the Random Forest model**, allowing for model retraining or adjustments with new datasets.  

## Key Features:  
- **Frontend:** A user-friendly interface built with Flask for form-based input.  
- **Backend:** A Random Forest machine learning model processes inputs and predicts loan eligibility.  
- **Training Code:** Includes scripts for preprocessing data and training the model, ensuring adaptability to new datasets or improved features.  

The dataset and model training code are available on Kaggle: [Loan Prediction Dataset and Training Code](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sarimr/loan-prediction-dataset).
